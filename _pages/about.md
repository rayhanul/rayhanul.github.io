I am Md. Rayhanul Islam is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University. My research lies in the synergy between formal methods, robotics, and control theory. My current focus involves quantifying inconsistencies in decision-making and perception within interacting agent scenarios. This research aims to facilitate the development of synthesis algorithms that identify and evaluate the source and effects of inconsistencies to improve overall system safety.

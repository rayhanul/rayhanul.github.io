I am Md. Rayhanul Islam. I have received my MS in Computer Science from [Iowa State University](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/) in Spring 2024. Previously, I received my Master's and Bachelor's degree from [University of Dhaka](http://www.du.ac.bd/), Bangladesh. My current research interests include Software security and memory safety, formal methods, and machine learning. 


I have a solid foundation in both web and software development knowledge using programming languages such as Rust, C, C++, Python, C#, Java, R, SQL, JavaScript, ASP.NET, CSS, and HTML. I am also adept at machine learning libraries such as Numpy, SciKit Learn, Pandas, Seaborn, SciPy, Pytorch, and Opacus. Additionally, I am proficient in model checking with tools like Prism, Storm, NuSMV, and Spin. Moreover, I am experienced in using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and the CARLA vehicle simulator for projects in AI, automation, and data-driven technologies. Currently, I am looking for an intern or full-time position in software development or formal verification.

# Course Project 
- **Custom Query Answering with RAG and Pre-Trained Models**, Course: COM S 579: Natural Language Processing, Spring 2024, <a href="https://github.com/rayhanul/COMS-579">Artifact</a>.   

     This project enables user to upload PDF files to a RAG platform and index the PDF files, then perform a query to the RAG system with a question and expect an answer based on the PDFs uploaded. An example demo is available here https://rayhan0201-chatarticle.hf.space.   

- **Policy Evaluation on Uncertain Environment**, Course: COM S 676X: Advanced Topics in Autonomous Systems and Robotics, Fall 2023 <a href="/documents/project_report/COMS676X_Final_project.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rayhanul/COMS676_project">Artifact</a>.  
     This work evaluates the initial policy and decides whether it satisfies the safety property for all valuations of parameters in a given parameter space using formal verification techniques, and it also suggests a new policy if the initial policy fails.

- **Optimum Motion Planning using PRM\* and RRT\***, Course: COM S 576: Motion Planning for Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Spring 2023, <a href="/documents/project_report/COMS576_project_final_report.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rayhanul/COMS576_Project">Artifact</a>.   

     This project implements sampling based motion planning algorithms and compares their results and also addresses possible improvements. 

 - **Vulnerability Detection using Program Slicing and Transformer-based Model**, Course: COM S 513 - Program Analysis, Fall 2022, <a href="/documents/project_report/513_Project_Report.pdf">PDF</a>.  
     This proposed approach makes slices based on the program points of interest where a generated slice is smaller in length than the function and includes statements from different parts of the function depending on the program point of interest.
